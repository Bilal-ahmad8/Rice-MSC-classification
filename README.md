## Overview

This project focuses on classifying rice varieties into different categories using a dataset of rice characteristics. The objective is to build a model that can accurately predict rice varieties based on features provided in a tabular format.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow` or `keras` (using deep learning models)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Data

The dataset used in this project consists of tabular data with various features related to rice varieties. Ensure that you have the dataset file available and that it is placed in the correct directory. The dataset should be organized with columns representing different attributes of rice and a target column indicating the rice variety.

## Notebook Structure

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:** This section involves loading the dataset, exploring the data, and visualizing key statistics and distributions.
2. **Preprocessing:** Data is already preprocessed.
3. **Model Building:** Implements and trains machine learning models for rice classification.
4. **Evaluation:** Assesses model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
5. **Results:** Presents the results and discusses the effectiveness of the model, including insights and performance metrics.

## Usage

To run the notebook, open it in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. Execute each cell sequentially to follow the workflow and observe the results. Make sure you have the dataset available in the expected directory.

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bilal-ahmad8/Rice-MSC-classification.git
   ```
